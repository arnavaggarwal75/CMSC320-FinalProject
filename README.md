### Why We Chose This Dataset
We chose this dataset because it is ideal for machine learning models aimed at predicting highly booked dates, booking cancellations, customer preferences, and revenue projections. It contains 19 features and 36,276 rows, which provide rich data for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA). The features include the number of adults, children, nights stayed, meal plans, room types, and pricing. This dataset is both practical and closely mirrors real-world challenges in the hospitality industry. Hotels often seek to minimize cancellations, predict customer behavior, and optimize pricing strategies, making this dataset suitable for addressing such industry-related problems.
